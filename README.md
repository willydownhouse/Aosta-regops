Front end for my Aosta Valley avalance observation application.

Observations are shown as markers on a map. You can click the marker and modal window opens with observation details and photo slider.

Adding a new observation requires authentication(Auth0).

After succesfull auth you see new observation button on navbar. Button click opens a modal with form for new observation.

Run development:

- npm start
